Epic is migrating its message videos from Vimeo to YouTube.

This [Vimeo Donwloader](https://github.com/epicsf/vimeo-downloader/)
gets all the video IDs/names/descriptions and other metadata, and downloads the original,
and downloads the original video file.

This takes the message videos and updates them to YouTube using
[YouTube's API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video).
